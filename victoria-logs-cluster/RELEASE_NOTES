- bump VictoriaLogs version to [v1.44.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/releases/tag/v1.44.0).
- `nodes/proxy` permission was removed from default clusterrole. This permission may be used to [raise privileges](https://grahamhelton.com/blog/nodes-proxy-rce). In case the vmagent will be used to scrape Kubelet's proxy endpoint, it is recommended to create a custom role with the necessary permissions.
